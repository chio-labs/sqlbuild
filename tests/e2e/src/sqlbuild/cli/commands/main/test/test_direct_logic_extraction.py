"""E2E: macro, UDF and table-function tests are split into CTEs under DuckDB's lexical rules.

Every compiler engine extracts these tests natively before and after expansion, so comments, DuckDB
nested comments and escape strings hide calls the same way, and the strict authoring rules (plain CTE
names, no logic calls outside the actual CTE, P012 for malformed reference calls) report the same
located errors.
