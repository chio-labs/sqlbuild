# SQLBuild Waffle Shop Playground

This project is a local DuckDB playground for SQLBuild. It is self-contained and does not require warehouse credentials.

## Try It

Compile the project:

```bash
sqb compile
```

Build the project locally with DuckDB:

```bash
sqb build
```

After the build creates the local DuckDB objects, run SQL unit tests:

```bash
sqb test
```

Run audits:

```bash
sqb audit
```

Inspect lineage:

```bash
sqb lineage fact_orders
```

## What This Shows

### Try semantic compilation

`sqb compile` checks the enforced source schemas offline. Change `o.quantity` to `o.qty` in
`models/marts/fact_orders.sql` to see an unknown-column error (B002). Add
`WHERE ordered_at > 5` to `models/staging/stg_orders.sql` to see DuckDB's timestamp/integer
comparison error (B217). Restore each edit after trying it; downstream models and SQL tests may
also report the consequences of a changed output column.

Proven bind-time failures are errors. Accepted conversions that may fail on data produce W21x
warnings and do not fail compilation. Unknown types remain unchecked. Type checks are enabled for
DuckDB/MotherDuck, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and BigQuery using each dialect's coercion rules.
Use `MODEL (sql_analysis false)`, a path default, or `--no-sql-analysis` to opt out.

### Project features

- DuckDB-backed local execution
- SQL models across staging, intermediate, and mart layers
- Seeds, expression-backed sources, and Python source loaders
- SQL unit tests and multi-model tests
- Built-in and custom audits
- SQL functions
- Macros and custom materialization hooks
- Incremental and partition-oriented model patterns

The local DuckDB database is created as needed when you run build-oriented commands.

## Source Loaders

Two raw tables are populated by Python loaders before the selected model DAG runs:

- `raw__customers` uses a list-returning loader with `write_strategy: table`.
- `raw__orders` uses a generator loader with `write_strategy: delete_insert` and `cursor_column: ordered_at`.

The payment source remains expression-backed, so the project demonstrates both managed source loaders and inline demo data.

Try the loader controls:

```bash
sqb build --no-load      # run models against already-loaded source tables
sqb build --reload       # reload sources while leaving models incremental
sqb load                 # run only source loaders
```
