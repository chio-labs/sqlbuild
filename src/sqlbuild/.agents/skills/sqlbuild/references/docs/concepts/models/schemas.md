Schema metadata defines column names, types, nullability, descriptions, and column audits. It can live inline in one `MODEL()` header or in a reusable `SCHEMA()` declaration.

## Inline columns

Use inline columns for metadata owned by one model:

```sql
MODEL (
  materialized view,
  description "Cleaned order records",
  columns (
    order_id (type INTEGER, nullable false, audits [not_null, unique]),
    customer_id (type INTEGER, nullable false, audits [not_null]),
    status (
      type VARCHAR,
      audits [accepted_values (values ["placed", "completed", "cancelled"])],
    ),
  ),
);
```

See [Audits](../audits.md) for built-in audits, custom audits, arguments, severity, and incremental run scope.

In incremental and snapshot models, an inline column can also declare `migrate_from <old column>` to rename the existing warehouse column in place and keep its history. See [Column migrations](column-migrations.md). Reusable `SCHEMA()` declarations don't accept `migrate_from`; a bound model adds it to an inherited column in its own header.

## Reusable schemas

When multiple models implement the same relation shape, declare it once in a schema role. SQLBuild discovers schema files recursively in each role.

| Location | Who can bind it |
|----------|-----------------|
| `schemas/` | Models anywhere in the project |
| `<folder>/_sqlbuild/schemas/` | Models in `<folder>` and below |
| `<folder>/_sqlbuild/_schemas/` | Models directly in `<folder>` only |

A reusable schema must live under the nearest folder containing every model that binds it or
schema that extends it. A top-level schema bound only by models under `models/marts/` fails to
compile with `S024` and names the destination, such as `models/marts/_sqlbuild/_schemas/`. Binding
a schema that is not visible from the model's folder fails with `S006`. See
[Where to Put Declarations](../declaration-scopes/placement.md).

```sql
-- schemas/orders/order.sql
SCHEMA (
  name order,
  description "Canonical staged order shape",
  columns (
    order_id (type INTEGER, nullable false, audits [not_null]),
    customer_id (type INTEGER, nullable false, audits [not_null]),
    status (type VARCHAR),
  ),
);
```

Bind a model with `model_schema`:

```sql
MODEL (
  materialized view,
  schema staging,
  model_schema order,
  contract enforced,
);
```

`schema staging` selects the warehouse destination schema. `model_schema order` selects reusable column metadata.

The reusable description becomes the model description when the model does not declare one. A model-owned description takes precedence.

## Model-local columns

A bound model may add output columns that are not part of the reusable shape:

```sql
MODEL (
  model_schema order,
  columns (
    ingestion_batch_id (type VARCHAR, nullable false),
  ),
  contract enforced,
);
```

Resolved schema columns retain their order and new model-local columns follow them. Use a named child schema when an extension is reusable; use inline columns for an extension owned by one model.

## Model-specific column audits

Audits in a reusable schema apply to every bound model. A model can add stricter audits to an inherited column by naming that column and declaring only `audits`:

```sql
MODEL (
  model_schema order,
  columns (
    order_id (audits [unique]),
  ),
);
```

The effective `order_id` keeps the reusable type, nullability, description, and `not_null` audit, then adds `unique`. A model cannot remove reusable audits or override inherited metadata. An inherited-column entry containing `type`, `nullable`, or `description` fails compilation. Identical audit instances are deduplicated.

## Inheritance

A reusable schema may extend one parent with additional columns:

```sql
SCHEMA (
  name sourced_order,
  extends order,
  columns (
    source (type VARCHAR, nullable false),
  ),
);
```

The parent must be visible from the child schema's owner folder, using the same rules as a model
binding a schema. Enum column types must likewise be visible from the schema's owner folder.

Inheritance may be transitive. Parent columns resolve before child columns. An inherited column cannot be redeclared or overridden in a child schema. SQLBuild rejects unknown parents, cycles, case-insensitive duplicates, and multiple parents.

Physical SQL output order is not currently enforced. Static contract analysis matches names and checks declared types and proven non-nullability. Runtime exact-contract validation matches names and types but does not validate nullability.

## Contracts and planning

`contract enforced` treats the complete named-plus-local declaration as the exact output shape. An unspecified model follows the project's `column_contract_mode`; `contract none` explicitly keeps the resolved columns as metadata, audit attachment, and type-enforcement inputs without activating shape validation. See [Contracts](contracts.md).

For models bound to a reusable schema, effective column names, types, nullability, and enum members participate in model version identity. Changing those fields on a parent therefore affects models bound through descendants. Descriptions do not change model identity. Audits have their own audit-gate identities, so audit changes invalidate reusable audit results without changing the model version itself.

## Limitations

Reusable schemas intentionally support a narrow ownership model:

- One optional parent, with transitive inheritance.
- Additive child and model-local output columns.
- Audit-only model augmentation of inherited columns, plus `migrate_from` column renames.
- No general column overrides, multiple inheritance, composition, mixins, parameters, or generated projections.
- No physical output ordinal enforcement.
