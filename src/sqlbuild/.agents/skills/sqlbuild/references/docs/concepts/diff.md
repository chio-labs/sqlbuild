SQLBuild can compare schemas and row-level data between two targets. This lets you validate that changes produce the expected results before they reach production.

`sqb diff FROM:TO` compares two targets, for example `prod:dev`.

`FROM` and `TO` resolve the authoritative database/schema namespaces to compare.
SQLBuild uses the `TO` target's named connection for the complete comparison and accesses both
namespaces through fully qualified relations. It does not resolve or open the `FROM` target's
connection. The `TO` connection must therefore be able to read both namespaces; missing credentials
for that execution connection still fail before warehouse inspection.

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select customer_status_snapshot
```

## Comparison modes

Every diff requires exactly one mode:

### Full diff

Compares both schema and row-level data for the selected models:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select fact_orders
```

Rows are joined on the model's `unique_key` and compared column by column. The output shows:
- Row counts for each side
- How many rows are equal, unequal, or only in one side
- Which columns have mismatches with match percentages
- Example values showing what changed

### Schema-only diff

Compares column names and types without looking at row data:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --schema-only --select fact_orders
```

Useful for quick structural checks or when row comparison would be too expensive.

### Bounded diff

Compares only a recent window of data using the model's cursor:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --bounded 14d --select hourly_order_activity
```

For timestamp cursors, the bound is a duration (`14d`, `6h`, `30m`). For integer cursors, the bound is an integer value. If the model has no cursor configured, the diff falls back to a full row comparison.

## Deterministic key sampling

A cursor bound limits the range of data but does not guarantee a predictable number of rows. Use
deterministic key sampling to cap the wide value comparison for a high-volume model:

```toml
[defaults]
row_diff_sample_rows = 100000
row_diff_sample_seed = 0

[path_defaults.intermediate]
row_diff_sample_rows = 25000
```

The settings use the normal configuration precedence: project `defaults`, matching
`path_defaults`, the model's `MODEL()` header, and finally CLI overrides. A model can disable an
inherited sample and request exhaustive comparison with `row_diff_sample_rows 0`:

```sql
MODEL (
  materialized table,
  unique_key [order_id, line_id],
  row_diff_sample_rows 0,
);
```

Override the effective policy for one invocation with `--sample-rows` and `--sample-seed`, or force
an exhaustive comparison with `--exhaustive`:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --bounded 14d --sample-rows 50000 --sample-seed 7 --select order_lines
sqb diff prod:dev --bounded 14d --exhaustive --select order_lines
```

SQLBuild applies the complete cursor bound first. It then selects the lowest deterministic hashes
from the union of unique keys found on either side and uses that same key set for both relations.
This avoids false side-only rows caused by independently sampling each side. Composite keys are
encoded with component lengths before hashing, and key columns break hash ties deterministically.

Schema comparison, bounded row counts, cursor minimum/maximum values, and null/duplicate key checks
remain exhaustive. Only the wide column-by-column comparison is sampled. If the bounded union has
no more keys than the configured limit, SQLBuild reports the comparison as exhaustive.

Sampled success means that no differences were found in the sampled keys; it is never reported as
complete table equality. The output shows the bounded key population, compared key count, seed, and
percentage evaluated.

## Cursor coverage

Before comparing values, SQLBuild reports exact bounded `COUNT`, `MIN(cursor)`, and `MAX(cursor)`
for each side. If cursor extents differ, it warns and continues with the requested comparison. It
does not ask for confirmation, silently narrow to the overlap, or hide rows that exist on only one
side.

## Row matching

Rows are matched between the two sides using a row key. By default, row identity comes from each model's `unique_key`. Repeated `--key` arguments override
that configuration for one invocation:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select order_lines \
  --key order_id \
  --key line_id
```

For a model without a stable row key, opt in to exact full-row multiset comparison with
`--unkeyed`. Duplicate rows retain their multiplicity; SQLBuild never guesses a key.

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select daily_order_totals --unkeyed
```

The diff output categorises rows as:
- **Equal** - same key, same values on both sides
- **Unequal** - same key, different values (with per-column breakdown)
- **Left only** - exists in the FROM side but not TO
- **Right only** - exists in the TO side but not FROM

## Tolerances

Numeric columns can have tolerance rules to avoid false positives from floating-point differences or acceptable variance. Configure tolerances in the model's `MODEL()` header:

```sql
MODEL (
  materialized incremental,
  ...
  row_diff_tolerances (
    by_column (
      total_revenue_cents (
        absolute 1,
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

Tolerance rules support:
- **`absolute`** - maximum allowed absolute difference (e.g. `1` means values differing by 1 or less are treated as equal)
- **`relative`** - maximum allowed relative difference as a decimal (e.g. `0.01` for 1%)

Tolerances can be set per-column (`by_column`) or per-type (`by_type`).

## Excluded columns

Columns that are expected to differ between the two sides (like timestamps or context-specific values) can be excluded from the row comparison:

```sql
MODEL (
  materialized incremental,
  ...
  row_diff_exclude_columns [latest_order_status],
);
```

Excluded columns are still shown in the schema comparison but skipped during row-level diffing. A column cannot be in both `row_diff_exclude_columns` and `unique_key`.

## Verbose output

Add `--verbose` or `-v` to see more example rows for mismatches and side-only rows:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select customer_status_snapshot --verbose
```

Default example limits are 3 per category. Verbose mode increases this to 10. You can also set exact limits:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select customer_status_snapshot --max-column-examples 20 --max-row-only-examples 5
```

Example limits only control diagnostic values printed after comparison. They are separate from
`row_diff_sample_rows`, which controls how many unique keys receive the wide value comparison.

## Structured output

Use `--json-output PATH` to write a stable structured result while retaining the normal terminal
summary:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --bounded 14d --sample-rows 50000 --select order_lines --json-output diff.json
```

Each model records `schema_only`, `exhaustive`, or `sampled` comparison scope; requested and observed
cursor coverage; bounded population and compared key counts; seed and configured limit; row result
counts; and changed-column counts. The top-level status distinguishes `no_differences_found` from
`differences_found`.

## Invocation safety limits

Use `--max-models` and `--max-columns` to put explicit hard limits around a broad selector. SQLBuild
fails visibly instead of truncating the selected models or compared columns:

```bash
sqb diff prod:dev --bounded 14d --sample-rows 50000 --max-models 10 --max-columns 80 --select path:models/intermediate
```

These limits are optional and apply to the complete invocation. `--max-columns` checks the larger
observed schema for each model before starting its row comparison.

## Selectors

Diff requires `--select` in the current version. You can use any selector syntax:

```bash
# Diff a single model
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select customer_status_snapshot

# Diff all models in a path
sqb diff prod:dev --schema-only --select path:models/marts

# Diff models with a specific tag
sqb diff prod:dev --full --select tag:acceptance
```

## Compare raw queries

Query mode omits `FROM:TO` because each query identifies its own input. Supply each side inline or
from a UTF-8 file, and choose keyed or unkeyed comparison explicitly:

```bash
sqb diff \
  --left-query 'SELECT order_id, amount_cents FROM analytics.orders_before' \
  --right-query 'SELECT order_id, amount_cents FROM analytics.orders_after' \
  --left-label before \
  --right-label after \
  --key order_id
```

```bash
sqb diff \
  --left-query-file queries/orders_before.sql \
  --right-query-file queries/orders_after.sql \
  --key account_id \
  --key order_id
```

Raw inputs must contain exactly one read-only `SELECT`, `WITH`, or `VALUES` expression. SQLBuild
does not expand `ref()` or other SQLBuild templates in these inputs. The active target connection
executes both sides; use `--target NAME` to select another configured connection.

Query mode performs a full comparison when no comparison mode flag is present. `--schema-only` is
also available. `--bounded` is model-specific; filter both raw queries directly when a bounded
query comparison is needed.

Raw-query discovery loads only project configuration, target configuration, and the selected
adapter. It does not import unrelated project sinks, hooks, loaders, or providers.

### Sampling, tolerances, and exclusions

Keyed query comparisons support deterministic union-key sampling and the same bounded mismatch
examples as model comparisons:

```bash
sqb diff \
  --left-query-file queries/orders_before.sql \
  --right-query-file queries/orders_after.sql \
  --key order_id \
  --sample-rows 50000 \
  --sample-seed 7
```

Use repeated invocation overrides where needed:

```bash
sqb diff \
  --left-query-file queries/orders_before.sql \
  --right-query-file queries/orders_after.sql \
  --key order_id \
  --exclude-column loaded_at \
  --tolerance amount_cents:absolute=1 \
  --tolerance conversion_rate:relative=0.001
```

`--exhaustive` disables inherited or requested sampling. Unkeyed comparison is always exhaustive
and exact, so it does not accept sampling or numeric tolerances.

### Bounded example values

Comparison remains exact regardless of how examples are rendered. By default, long values are
limited to 160 characters and show context around the first differing character. Every shortened
value is marked as truncated and includes its original length.

Control evidence independently from the number of collected examples:

```bash
# Increase the displayed context without changing comparison scope.
sqb diff --left-query-file before.sql --right-query-file after.sql \
  --key order_id --max-value-length 500

# Retain keys and aggregate counts but suppress example values.
sqb diff --left-query-file before.sql --right-query-file after.sql \
  --key order_id --no-example-values

# Explicitly opt in to complete values. --verbose alone remains bounded.
sqb diff --left-query-file before.sql --right-query-file after.sql \
  --key order_id --full-example-values
```

Ordinary keys are kept complete. Exceptionally long keys are shortened with an explicit length and
stable digest so an operator can still identify them without flooding terminal output.

### Stable query results and cleanup

SQLBuild materializes each raw query once in the selected target's default schema before comparing
it. Artifacts use a reserved run-owned name and are dropped immediately when the command finishes,
including after comparison errors.

Each successfully created artifact publishes an immutable `query_diff_artifact` fingerprint. The
fingerprint is ownership evidence for crash recovery only: running and comparing the queries never
reads historical fingerprints, and fingerprints do not represent planned, running, complete, or
cleaned workflow states.

If a process stops before immediate cleanup, the next query diff and `sqb janitor` can remove an
expired artifact only when its exact physical identity and reserved name match its ownership
fingerprint. A matching name without ownership evidence is reported for manual investigation and
is not deleted automatically.

The recovery TTL defaults to 24 hours and accepts SQLBuild fixed-duration syntax:

```toml
[diff]
query_artifact_ttl = "24h"
```

The TTL is a crash-recovery backstop, not the normal cleanup path. Historical ownership inspection
problems are reported but do not prevent the current queries from running. Failure to publish
ownership for a newly created artifact, or failure to remove a current-run artifact, is an execution
error.

### Query output and exit codes

Use `--json-output PATH`, or `--json` to emit one JSON document to stdout while all
lifecycle progress remains on stderr. Query results include `input_kind = "query"`, named left and
right inputs, `query_comparisons`, sparse nonzero `column_mismatches`, lifecycle timings, and
explicit example truncation metadata. Existing `models` output remains available for compatibility.

Raw-query automation distinguishes complete findings from incomplete evidence and execution
failure:

| Exit | Outcome |
|---:|---|
| `0` | Complete comparison with no differences |
| `1` | Complete comparison with findings |
| `2` | Safety, schema, or key preflight prevented complete value evidence |
| `3` | Setup, connection, materialization, comparison execution, ownership, or cleanup failed |

Human output and JSON use the same outcome. Lifecycle messages include elapsed connection,
reconciliation, inspection, materialization, comparison, cleanup, and total durations.

## Exit codes

In model mode, `sqb diff` returns exit code `0` when all selected models have no differences, and `1` when any model has schema or row differences. Raw-query mode uses the exit codes in [Query output and exit codes](#query-output-and-exit-codes). This makes it usable in CI pipelines as a validation gate.
