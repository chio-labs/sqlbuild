# Databricks

> Databricks adapter configuration for SQLBuild.

Online: https://sqlbuild.com/docs/concepts/adapters/databricks/

The Databricks adapter is in beta: builds, tests and plans work, but it has had less production use so far. Please [report issues](https://github.com/chio-labs/sqlbuild/issues).

Databricks requires the optional `databricks-sql-connector` dependency:

```bash
pip install 'sqlbuild[databricks]'
# or
uv pip install 'sqlbuild[databricks]'
```

## Connection config

```toml
adapter = "databricks"
default_target = "dev"

[connections.workspace]
server_hostname = "my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
http_path = "/sql/1.0/warehouses/abc123"
token = "dapi_my_access_token"

[targets.dev]
connection = "workspace"
database = "my_catalog"
schema = "my_schema"
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `server_hostname` | Databricks workspace hostname (required) |
| `http_path` | SQL warehouse or cluster HTTP path (required) |
| `token` | Personal access token (required) |

The target's `database` selects the Unity Catalog catalog, and its `schema` selects the schema.

## Session initialization

On connect, SQLBuild runs `USE CATALOG` and `USE SCHEMA` statements from the active target to set
the authoritative session namespace.
