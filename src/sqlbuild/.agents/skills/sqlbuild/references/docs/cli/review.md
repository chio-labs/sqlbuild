`sqb review` checks a branch before it merges. It finds the models and seeds the branch changed,
builds them and their affected downstream models in a schema it creates for this run, runs the
unit tests and audits those changes affect, compares every built model with the same model in
another target, and reports the result as text, JSON or Markdown with an exit code a CI job can
gate on.

## Usage

```bash
sqb review --since origin/main --against prod
sqb review --since origin/main --against prod --dry-run
sqb review --since origin/main --against prod --json --markdown review.md
```

Two baselines drive a review:

- **`--since <ref>`** is the code baseline. The changed set is everything that differs between
  the merge base of `<ref>` and `HEAD` (including uncommitted edits), worked out exactly as
  [`sqb test --since`](test.md#run-only-affected-tests) does.
- **`--against <target>`** is the data baseline: the target whose tables the review compares
  with, reads unchanged upstream models from, and clones changed incremental models from.

Both can come from `sqlbuild_project.toml` (see [Configuration](#configuration)), so a project
with `[git] base_ref` and `[review] against` runs a review with plain `sqb review`.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--since <ref>` | Git ref whose merge base with `HEAD` is the code baseline; `@base` reads `[git] base_ref` (default: `[git] base_ref`) |
| `--against <target>` | Target to compare with and to read unchanged upstream from (default: `[review] against`) |
| `--downstream <policy>` | Which unchanged downstream models to build and compare: `critical` (default), `all` or `none` |
| `--select`, `-s` | Narrow the review to these nodes of the changed set; see [Selecting](#selecting) |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan without connecting to the warehouse |
| `--no-clone` | Start changed incremental models and snapshots from a full refresh instead of a clone |
| `--bounded <window>` | Compare models too large for an exact comparison within a recent cursor window, such as `14d` |
| `--markdown <path>` | Also write the report as Markdown to `<path>` |
| `--json` | Print one JSON document on stdout; progress goes to stderr |
| `--target <name>` | Active target whose connection runs the review and whose schema holds the ownership marker |
| `--concurrency <n>` | Build concurrency |
| `--vars` | Project variables, as for `sqb build` |

## What gets built

The **changed set** is every model or seed whose definition changed, whose configuration changed,
or that reads a changed source, function or macro. Changes that build nothing, such as an edited
source declaration or unit test, are listed under "What changed" but are not built themselves.

`--downstream` decides which unchanged models below the changed set are built too:

- `critical` builds the models on every path from a changed node to a critical model. A model is
  critical when its `MODEL` header sets [`critical true`](../concepts/models/configuration.md), or
  when it carries one of the tags in `[review] critical_tags` (default `["critical"]`).
- `all` builds every downstream model.
- `none` builds only the changed set.

Downstream models the policy leaves out are always listed as **not validated**, with the reason.
The impact tree is computed from the whole changed set, whatever the policy.

Upstream models outside the build are read from `--against`, as with
[`sqb build --defer-to`](build.md). A changed incremental model or snapshot starts from a
zero-copy clone of its `--against` table when the adapter supports zero-copy clones and the
`--against` target allows being a clone origin; otherwise, or with `--no-clone`, it is built with
a full refresh. The report says which start each one got and why.

## Selecting

`--select` intersects with the review scope: only the selected nodes are built and compared; the
rest of the scope is listed as not validated. Each selector must name something the review can
check, or the review fails before connecting:

| Selection | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| A name that matches no node | `C761` |
| Only nodes the branch did not change and that nothing changed above | `C762` |
| Only affected nodes the downstream policy leaves out | `C763` |

## The review schema

A review builds into a schema named `<prefix>_<UTC timestamp>_<commit>_<run>`, for example
`REVIEW_20261023T101500Z_3f9c2ab_4e1d0a`. Before creating it, the review writes an ownership marker
to the active target schema's `_sqlbuild_fingerprints` table, and it refuses a schema that already
exists. The schema is always dropped when the review ends, whether it passed or not; a failed drop
makes the review fail with exit code `3`. [`sqb janitor`](janitor.md#review-schemas) drops
marked review schemas left behind for more than 24 hours.

The adapter must be able to drop a whole schema: SQLite and SQL Server targets cannot run a review.

## Checks

- **Unit tests** that execute a changed node, chosen as `sqb test --since` chooses them, run on the
  active target. The report counts how many unaffected tests were skipped.
- **Audits** of the built models run during the build.
- **Comparison** of every built model with its `--against` table: column names and types, row
  counts, and, when the model has a `unique_key` and the [size guard](diff.md#size-guard)
  allows, an exact keyed diff with branch-only keys, target-only keys and changed values, each with
  example keys. A model the size guard blocks is compared within `--bounded` when given and the
  model has a cursor. Models without a `unique_key` get the schema and row-count checks only.

Any difference is a finding: a schema change, a different row count, branch-only or target-only
keys, a changed value, a failed unit test or a failed audit. A check that could not run, such as
the keyed diff of a model without a `unique_key`, is reported as **incomplete coverage**. A model
that does not exist in `--against` yet is built but not compared, and the Baseline section says so.

## Output

Text output starts with the outcome, then findings, what changed, the downstream impact tree with
each node's status (`built`, `ok`, `finding` or `not validated` and why), incomplete coverage, the
baseline, tests and audits, and run details: the review schema and its cleanup, the downstream
policy, and the [`sqb recall output`](recall.md) command that shows the whole run.

`--markdown <path>` writes the same report as Markdown for a pull request comment: a title with the
outcome, a summary table, numbered findings, and per-model evidence in collapsed `<details>` blocks
that list only the columns that changed.

`--json` prints one document with `format_version`, `status` (`passed`, `findings`, `incomplete`,
`failed` or `planned`), `exit_code`, `since`, `against`, `summary`, `findings`, `changed`,
`validated`, `not_validated`, `nodes`, `impact_edges`, `incomplete`, `baseline`, `tests`, `audits`,
`review_schema`, `recall` and `error`. The document is written on every path, including failures.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Passed: every check ran and found no difference, or a dry run |
| `1` | Findings |
| `2` | Incomplete coverage, and no findings |
| `3` | The review could not set up, run or clean up |

A failure takes precedence over findings, and findings over incomplete coverage.

## Configuration

```toml
[git]
base_ref = "origin/main"

[review]
against = "prod"
downstream = "critical"
schema_prefix = "REVIEW"
critical_tags = ["critical"]
```

See [Review](../concepts/project-configuration.md#review) in the project configuration reference.
